# Tandem Game

A language-learning game for one or two people built with React, TypeScript and Vite. In the two-player game each player is a native speaker of the language the other is learning. You take turns: the game shows a sentence in your own language, you translate it aloud into the language you are learning, and your partner judges it. The app itself does no scoring or judging.

## How to play

Start by choosing **1 player** or **2 players**.

### On your own (1 player)

Pick the language you speak, the number of sentences (1 to 5), the difficulty and a topic (one of ten everyday ones, or your own). An AI writes the sentences in your language, with their translations. Review them (ask for new ones if something looks off) and tap "Looks good". For each sentence, say it aloud in the language you are learning, tap "Show translation" to check yourself, then "Next turn". Nothing is sent to another device, and there is no scoring.

### With a partner (2 players)

1. One player chooses "Create a game", picks the language they speak, and sets up the round: a topic (one of ten everyday ones, or their own), how many sentences each player gets (1 to 5), the difficulty, and whether translations are shown after each turn.
2. They send their partner the invite link (or the 5-character code). The partner joins and picks the language they speak; each of you then learns the other's language.
3. An AI writes the sentences. Each player reviews the ones they will read aloud (in their own language) and either can ask for new ones. The round starts when both tap "Looks good".
4. Take turns translating aloud; your partner judges. With translations on, the speaker taps "Show translation" when done, or "Next turn" to skip it.

Be on a call or in the same room: translations are spoken, not typed.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server with hot reload (http://localhost:5173/)
npm run build    # type-check and bundle into dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build locally
npm run lint
npm test         # unit tests (Vitest)
npm run e2e      # end-to-end tests (Playwright); against the live site unless E2E_URL is set
```

Requires Node 22 (see `.nvmrc`). Pushing to `main` runs lint, unit tests and the build, redeploys the Worker if it is affected, runs the e2e tests against the built site, and only then publishes to GitHub Pages. To generate sentences locally you also need the Worker running, see [docs/ai-sentences.md](docs/ai-sentences.md#try-it-locally).

## How it is put together

- `src/content/`: topics and the `ContentSource` interface screens use to get sentences.
- `src/game/`: pure game rules (building a round, advancing turns) and the host's round setup.
- `src/online/`: keeps the two devices in sync. The host's device holds the real state and sends a full copy to the guest after every change; the guest only sends requests. Everything received is validated in `protocol.ts`. Devices talk over [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) (WebRTC), behind a `Network` interface that tests replace with an in-memory fake.
- `src/generation/` and `worker/`: AI sentence generation. The host's browser calls a Cloudflare Worker, which asks Workers AI to write the sentences and validates the answer. See [docs/ai-sentences.md](docs/ai-sentences.md).

### Limits

- It is peer-to-peer. A free public PeerJS service introduces the two devices, so a game cannot start while it is down, and some strict networks block direct connections.
- If the host closes the tab the game ends. A guest who drops can rejoin with the same code while the host is still there.
- Only one guest can join a game.
- Sentences come from a small model on Cloudflare's free plan, so they can be odd and the daily allowance can run out.
